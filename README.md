# People Museum

"I would trade all my technology for an afternoon with Socrates.‚Äù -- Steve Jobs

The People Museum app empowers ordinary people-- not just coders-- to create gen-AI powered conversations as Steve Jobs asked some years ago, and to build collections of interesting people. Teachers and historians can build educational experiences for their students, communities can build people collections that illustrate the greatness of the group.
